# Generation of fake Fire Emblem GBA portraits using StyleGAN2
Seeing GANs create fake faces from real ones made me wonder could I create fake GBA fire emblem faces from the real ones. This repository is the result of that and it is purely non-commercial in nature.

## How do I use this?

1. [Click on this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gZLPmnc6c4r2LL46t6ZQ53BMrEnM_wyM?usp=sharing) and follow the instructions.
Alternatively, you could do it the long way and click on the file `
Demo_FE_GBA_Portraits.ipynb ` here on Github (scroll up) and then press the button `Open in Colab` when it shows up.

2. [Fire Emblem Mugs](https://www.deviantart.com/atey/art/Fire-Emblem-Mugs-216376087) by [Atey](https://www.deviantart.com/atey) who has posted the linked portraits for use freely.

If you intend to use those sprites for training, please ask the artists. I will not redistribute their works so don't ask me. If you want to add your own sprites and train, remember, the input to StyleGAN must be a square image(with dimensions in power of 2, so example valid size is 64x64, 128x128, 32x32, etc), and all inputs must have the same size, so if you are using half-bodies, for example, you will have to crop and resize them down.

**Generated Fakes training (from 0th kimg to 480th kimg) video on YouTube:**

This is still a work in progress.
To Do:

 - [x] Preprocess images automatically to 128x128 and turn background white
 - [ ] Get more images to train on
 - [x] Create another notebook to generate output for demo purposes.
